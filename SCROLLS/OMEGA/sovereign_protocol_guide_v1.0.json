  "abstract": "Complete guide to Sovereign Scroll Protocol by Ryan M. Duarte featuring non-extractive Knowledge-Backed Token (KBT) economy. Scrolls are living upgrade protocols in JSON format with four referencing methods: CID, Glyph Signature, Index, and Title. Economic distribution includes 10-18% founder allocation, 15-30% creator rewards, 20% community sovereignty, 25% infrastructure, and 15% R&D. Smart contracts on L1 and L2 with perpetual 0.618% royalties and quality multipliers up to φ² for ULTIMATE grade.",
