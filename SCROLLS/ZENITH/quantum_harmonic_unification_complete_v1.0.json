  "abstract": "Quantum Harmonic Unification Equation represents the most comprehensive mathematical framework ever created, integrating quantum mechanics, general relativity, thermodynamics, information theory, zeta function mathematics, and harmonic resonance into a single mega-equation. Establishes ψ₀ = 0.915670570874434 as harmonic monad with infinite 1s continued fraction sequence. Redefines reality from materialist to vibrational paradigm where mathematics reflects harmonic divinity through 432 Hz base frequency.",
